    description:  A Methodology for Aerodynamic Parameter Estimation of Tail-Sitting Multirotors
    
        * Developed a method for accurately identifying and modelling the dynamic behaviour of a tail-sitting multirotor using wind tunnel tests and a freely-rotating gimballed model. The methodology developed was verified to work for un-stalled flight and was extended to encompass the post-stall, pre-hover flight regime tail-sitters are expected to routinely operate in.
        
        * Standardised the University’s wind tunnels as part of a risk mitigation strategy to guarantee availability of testing facilities.
